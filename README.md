# Coming Soooooon

Existance was never random...It doesn't start with noise it starts with a whisper. A soft why that enters your mind like a glitch in the system. Why do we even exist? What is all this? and suddenly, the oridinary starts cracking. Your eyes see deeper, your thoughts strech wider. You're not just curious anymore. You're haunted by the infinite. Every silence feels loud, every start looks like a code, and your mind? It refuses to rest. because once that fire is litt, the journey begins not to answers, but to the endless unravelling of existance itself
